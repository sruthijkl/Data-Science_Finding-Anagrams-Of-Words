The Word Anagrams project focuses on processing a dataset of English words to identify anagrams. Using Python,I loaded and cleaned the word data, classifed words by their length, and then found anagrams within each length group. The goal was to work with Python's built-in data structures like Lists and Dictionaries to manipulate, clean, and group the words effectively.

Libraries Used:
os: For file handling operations (e.g., unzipping files, listing directory contents).

collections: For managing dictionaries and sets (e.g., defaultdict for easier grouping).

itertools: For generating combinations and permutations to identify anagrams.

re: For text cleaning and pattern matching (e.g., removing unwanted characters).

string: For handling string operations like converting words to lowercase.
